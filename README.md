#RiotSummonerSearch

Description: This project uses the Riot Games API to retrieve summoner ranked information given a summoner name.
A user chooses their region and then enters their summoner name to retrieve rank, win rate, Top 3 most played champions
and top 3 highest win rate champions with over 10 games played.

References: I used the YouTube user SNAP's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NycEiHOeX8 to learn how to use Python requests to 
access the Riot API. From there I used the documentation at https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods to gather the information necessary to make my own project.
